# Breast Cancer Prediction
# Overview
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast
cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging
historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for
assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.
# Dataset
The dataset used for this prediction is [dataset.csv](https://github.com/DINAPRASANTH/Breastcancerprediction_CVIP-datascience/blob/main/data.csv) is sourced from kaggle.
The dataset contains the following features:
- radius_mean
- texture_mean
- perimeter_mean
- area_mean
- smoothness_mean
- compactness_mean
- concavity_mean
- concave points_mean
- symmetry_mean
- fractal_dimension_mean

The target variable diagnosis which indicates whether the tumor is bening(B) or Malingnant(M).

# Random Forest Model Development
In this section, we'll outline the steps to develop a Random Forest model for breast cancer prediction using Python and scikit-learn.

# Steps
# Data Preprocessing:
- Load the breast cancer dataset.
- Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
- Check for missing data and handle it if necessary.
- Encode categorical variables if applicable.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

# Feature Selection:
Perform feature selection to choose the most relevant features for the prediction task. You can use techniques like feature importance from the Random Forest model.
# Model Initialization:
- Import the Random Forest classifier from scikit-learn.
- Initialize the Random Forest classifier with hyperparameters like the number of        estimators,maximum depth, and other relevant settings.

# Model Training:

- Fit the Random Forest classifier to the training data.
- Train the model on the selected features.

# Model Evaluation:

- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.
- Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

# Conclusion:
Summarize the results and insights gained from the breast cancer prediction model.
